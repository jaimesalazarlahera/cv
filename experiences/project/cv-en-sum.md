type: project
title: 'CV'
---

This CV was developed with NextJS and is hosted on Vercel. It converts markdown (`.md` files) to the html you see here with `React`. It also uses `pdfMake` to create the downloadable PDF version of this site.

Other frontends I've created also use React, and I have some knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (usually opting for TypeScript).
